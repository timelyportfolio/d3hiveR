# d3hiveR

R htmlwidget for `d3.js` hive plots from `HiveR` data objects `HivePlotData`.  Please see the Building Widgets blog post [Week 27 | d3hiveR](http://www.buildingwidgets.com/blog/2015/7/11/week-27-d3hiver) for examples and discussion.

For this to be as good as I would like, I'll need some help and would love feedback, use cases, github issues, or pull requests.
